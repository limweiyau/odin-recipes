        <ul>
            <li> 1 pound sweet Italian sausage </li>
            <li> ¾ pound lean ground beef </li>

            <li> ½ cup water </li>
            <li> 2 tablespoons white sugar </li>
            <li> 4 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, divided </li>
            <li> 1 ½ teaspoons dried basil leaves </li>
            <li> 1 ½ teaspoons salt, divided, or to taste </li>
            <li> 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning </li>
            <li> ½ teaspoon fennel seeds </li>
            <li> ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper </li>
            <li> 12 lasagna noodles </li>
            <li> 16 ounces ricotta cheese </li>
            <li> 1 egg </li>
            <li> ¾ pound mozzarella cheese, sliced </li>
            <li> ¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese </li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <u> Directions </u> 
        <ol>
            <li> Gather all your ingredients </li><br>
            <li> Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned. </li><br>
            <li> Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 ½ hours, stirring occasionally. </li><br>
            <li> Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. </li><br>
            <li> In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt. </li><br>
            <li> Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). </li><br>
            <li> To assemble, spread 1 ½ cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce, overlapping slightly. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 ½ cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. </li><br>
            <li> Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese. </li><br>
            <li> Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes. </li><br>
            <li> Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving. </li><br>
        </ol>
